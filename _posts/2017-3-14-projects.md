## TAG_Neural_Network
This is a project that combines linguistically rich embeddings of trees from a Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) with a Feedforward Neural Network for classifying parser moves using a dependency parser. It has a variety of methods associated with it, which are detailed in the project README.

## Phon_Phon
This is a project that learns the relevant SPE style phonological features for English plural morphology. The goal was to test if these features are actually useful in determining what morphemes are expressed.

## SPE_Rule_Generator
This is a project still being developed. The goal is to take a language
inventory, a set of phonological features, a list of possible allophones, and a set of 
words in the language and learn the SPE style rules that generate the allophones. It 
works for a variety of example data sets from Zsiga (2013). However, in future 
development it will learn these rules with less supervision.

## UD_STAG
This is a project to take the dependency treebanks from Universal Dependencies and learn 
tree structures similar to those in Tree-Adjoining Grammars. These would then be associated 
with individual lexical items in the UD training sentences, in the hopes that this will lead
to improved cross linguistic parsing through an increased amount of linguistic information 
associated with the data.
