I am interested in computational psycholinguistics. In particuluar, I want to understand the representational content of language and how language is processed incrementally. Within linguistics, I am interested in the interaction of levels of linguistic representation, such as the mapping of phonetics to phonology, the relationship between prosodic and morphological structure, and how pragmatics and discourse shape and influence syntactic representations. Within psycholinguistics and cognitive science, I am interested in event representaions and how linguistic structure follows from dynamic representations.

Recently, I have been working on limits in computational modeling due to distinctions between language comprehension and production with relative clause attachment, the phonological representation of compounds and stress using corpora, and what aspects of pragmatic and discourse knowledge can be acquired from raw text.

### Fun Things

I try to hike and rock climb as much as possible. I have a cat Figaro, who spends his days sitting on my keyboard, scratching
my couch, and meowing for food.
