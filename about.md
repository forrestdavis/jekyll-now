I am a Ph.D candidate in Linguistics at Cornell University focusing on Computational Linguistics. For my undergraduate studies, I attended Columbia University, where I received a B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am interested in the intersection of computational methods, mathematical formalisms and linguistics. As an undergraduate, I worked with Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG). Initially, I focused on representing individual trees in the grammar as vectors denoting features motivated by linguistic properties like voice and subcategorization frames. Later, I implemented a feedforward neural network for predicting a dependency parser transition based on the tree for a lexical item determined by a TAG. Work from these projects contributed to a [publication](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-6213) in TAG+13. 

My broader research interests are in learnability of linguistic systems. I aim to use techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence to implement linguistic theories in the hopes of furthering our understanding of the capacity for humans to use language. Currently, I am interested in modeling phonological systems. Particularly, I am concerned with the learnability of both phonological features (in the style of Sound Patterns of English) and phonological rules using acoustic data. I have further interests in semantics and pragmatics, through a theoretical and computational perspective. 

### Fun Things

I try to hike and rock climb as much as possible. I have a cat Figaro, who spends his days sitting on my keyboard, scratching
my couch, and meowing for food.
